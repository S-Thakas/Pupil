# Pupil
The details stored for a pupil in school include the name and the marks for three subjects taken. Two operations done on any pupil are computing and returning the mean mark; and computing and returning the comment based on the mean mark i.e. either "Very good" (if the mean is at least 70), or "Good" (if the mean is at least 50), or otherwise "Fair".

Required: Write a C# program with a class named pupil for this problem. Include a default constructor, as well as creating one object and calling method(s)Â appropriately.
